# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **microCarbon in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **install microCarbon**.

Or **try microCarbon immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://www.microcarbon.org/new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Install microCarbon

Clone microCarbon from [official repo](https://github.io/).

```bash
$ git clone [microCarbon github url] 
$ cd microcarbon
$ ./install.sh
```

The shell scripts `install.sh` command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run microCarbon.

## Start your microCarbon

Run the development server:

```bash
cd microcarbon
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created microCarbon site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds microCarbon locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
